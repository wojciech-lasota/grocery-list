# grocery-list
[from  john-smilga course](https://www.johnsmilga.com/)

The objective of this JavaScript grocery list project is to create a list that accepts an item and also saves it to local storage. If the user tries to submit a blank item, the top container in the project alerts the user to add an item with an “alert” message. If the user successfully adds an item, the top container alerts the user with a “success” message. Every time an item is added, the item is displayed in the DOM and is also saved to the user's local storage. If the user clicks the “clear items” button, all items will be removed from the DOM and local storage. If the user clicks just one of the delete item icons, only that item will be removed.
